# Unit-6-LB1-Grading-Policy
Instructions: Write a grading program for a class with the following grading policies:

  A. There are two quizzes, each graded on the basis of 10 points
  B. There is one midterm exam and one final exam, each graded on the basis of 100 points
  C. The final exam counts for 50% of the grade, the midterm counts for 25% and the two quizzes together count for a total of 25%.  (Do not forget to normalize the quiz scores.  They should be converted to a percent before they are averaged in).


Any grade of 90 or more is an A, any grade of 80 or more (but less than 90) is a B, 
any grade of 70 or more (but less then 80) is a C, any grade of 60 or more (but less than 70) is a D, 
any grade below 60 is an F.


The program will read in the student’s score (two quiz and two exams) and output the student’s record, 
which consists of two quiz and two exam scores as well as the student’s average numeric score for the 
entire course and the final letter grade.
